Shifting policies of solidarity are what the authors want to investigate in this paper: from a model of national identity based on the concept of turkishness to one based on the (supposedly) more encompassing religious identity of being sunni muslims. If the former posed the basis for the long lasting conflictual contrast of turkishness vs kurdishness, the latter looks more inclusive in its nature, based on the idea of islamic solidarity.

As a general concept we can state that some sort of solidarity is found in every society, since it's one of the bonds that keep a society together, it can be found indifferent forms, like a feeling shared by members of a group, a redistributive welfare system, a bond derived by some sort idea of common history or origin. Depending on the unit of analysis it assumes different natures, for example an ascriptive inclusive identity or a more insitutional fabric meant to hold society together.

It is introduced the main proposed division between the kind of solidarity:

> two kinds of solidarity: "solidarity among strangers" which  we will designate with the capital S, and other forms if solidarity informed by group interest or ascriptive identity, designed by small s. While both kinds of solidarity refer to a sense of belonging, feeling of togetherness and cooperation, the former has a normative priority over the latter. This is because S, without precluding the existing of ingroup solidarities, provides an inclusive framework that makes inter-group solidarity among strangers possible.

The main argument of this paper is that S is a complex form of solidarity that can be realized and achieved only through a triangulated coexistence of liberty, equality and solidarity. Therefore is presented as part of a political process and born and achieved from political will:

>S cannot be viewed as the outcome of an evolutionary process [...] It is rather the political failures to acknowledge and meet the demands for individual rights that lead to a situation where S breaks down into soidarities based on sameness.

The breaking down of these inter group bonds is then seen as a process which is started from a political failure but then it is bolstered by preexisting ingroup solidarities that

>further erode the ideals and institutions on which equal freedoms and democratic inclusion should ideally rest.

The case sustained in the paper is that both Islamic solidarity and Kurdishness are forms of in-group solidarity generated as a consequence of the lacking of the above mentioned triangulation.

According to Ritter [@ritter_irrational_1948] pre modern forms of solidarity (or as he calls them with a less controversial definition "irrational solidarities") are based on shared identity and common historical descent. Bugra and Candas expand this conceptualization to state that:

>While solidarity among strangers prioritizes equal membership in a political community over ascriptive identities and thus refers to forging new bonds among strangers, this inclusive regime could nevertheless let other types of solidarities coexist along with the overarching citizenship identity.

The link between Solidarity and welfare regime transformation under neoliberalist policies is then explained as:

>The satisfaction of economic needs of the disadvantaged and their right to be recognized as equal members can either remain unmet, be transfered to voluntary and fickle benevolence or left to be satisfied through culturally informed practices within the closed community. [...] (subsequently) the principle of equal freedom of all is seriously challenged in all cases where charity replaces formal rights based state transfers. [...] In the case of particularly disadvantaged groups, such arbitrary and informal arrangements would necessarily exacerbate existing inequalities among the members of the wider society and widen the gaps among the communities.

The endogenous factor is the key element to explain a "cultural" shift to narrower forms of solidarity:

>people who belong to different identity or interest groups might, at a particular historical juncture, begin to prioritize their ascriptive identity over the social bond defined in terms of inclusive democratic citizenship. [...] not necessarily because people conceive of s as an aleternative to an already established S, but most likely because S is not available or failed and became delegitimized within that context.

(again we see a link to economic crisis as also pointed out by Tugal [@tugal_contesting_2013], in this sense if it's all about economic policies toward welfare and economic conjunctions we should expect something like Kondrateff's waves in diffusion of solidarity and political polarization)

With the pursuing of neoliberalist economic policies and the further delegation of welfare system to the sphere of civil society there is the risk of bolstering forms of solidarity than are based on ascriptive identity groups and not on rights of citizenship and equality, therefore while promoting initiatives of community empowerment to substitute social welfare these projects are at the same time undermining the bases itself for inclusive practices that are essential for a working democracy.

In this light we can see why understanding the processes on which different group styles are built is of primary importance to distinguish between "succesful" or outgoing bond creation and "unsuccesful" or in-group bonding.

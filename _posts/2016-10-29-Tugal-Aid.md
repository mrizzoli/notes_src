In Tugal's view the double movement as expressed by Polanyi is a continuous struggle between hegemonic powers and counter hegemony that contraposes market economy and social groups, in his analysis conducted in sultanbeyli he sees how excluded strata of society get included in power relations based on clientelism in the act of realizing a passive revolution, pushing forward this interpretation he then analyzes benevolent associations to understand if and how these are part of the same cooptation by hegemonic powers or are part of the counter movement.

>I argue that civil society menaces to undermine the double movement in the neoliberal age [...] My findings corroborate critical literature that draws attention to the close linkage and mutual reinforcement between NGOs and neoliberalization.

(but how does this cooptation work? is it an irrational attitude due to some form of adaptation to neoliberalist policies? is it a consequence of top down governmental policies?)

Apparently there is a strong correlation between the expansion of neoliberalist economic policies and the spread of charitable organizations, and he reads it with: 

>a perspective that sees aid as reinforcing the dominance of powerful groups

Some associations ephasize on the individual respnsability for social exclusion and poverty, thus adhering to neoliberalist ideology (see also [@isik_vakif_2014]), and this leads the author to pose the main question: "*Do communitarian aid groups represent a counter-movement to marketization?*"

We can try to rephrase it for our own curiosity about civil society's virtuous spyral as expressed by Putnam to: "do communitarian aid groups create succesful social bonds?"

The author categorize the associations oppoing their attitude toward the "professionality" required to deliver aid properly according to market economy and toward the responsibility of poverty, wether it's on the poor themselves or to society and economic policies. This juxtaposition serves the purpose ot oppose market oriented charities to protection oriented ones.

interestingly enough one ofthe interviewees explained the origin of poverty as the cutting of bonds between the poor and the better off:

>The responsible persons severed their links with the poor (cfr pg 149)

Introduction
============

In this paper I’m going to discuss and present Ottoman Empire’s policies in its goal to incorporate nomadic tribes in its society, this aim
was pursued in different ways through time, adapting strategies accordingly to the context. Beginning from the Tanzimât Era, the Ottoman
Empire attempted various reforms to resist the disintegration processes it was facing. The declining central authority tried to revive its
power modernizing the military and bureaucratic apparatus and reforming the tax revenue system, in particular the latter was performed
performing the first census and cadastral survey. One of the main issues that the Empire had to face was the ethnic and social segmentation
that produced a centrifugal force among the population, although we have to wait for the article 8 in the 1876’s constitution to have a
clear statement about Ottoman Citizenship, we can trace back to the Tanzimât Fermânı, where the Sultan extended and granted equal rights
(but also equal duties) to the entire population of the Empire, a first idea to overcome the danger of social dismemberment.

The long attempted sedentarization and acculturation of the nomadic tribes dwelling the Empire, that before Gülhane Edict had mainly
economic and security purposes, were thus pursued in the new light of transforming them into citizens. Besides the ongoing problem of tax
evasion, the main economic challenges nomads posed to the Empire were three-folded: the pillaging raids *reduced producers’ ability to pay
taxes fear of raids diminished economic productivity by reducing the area under cultivation and restricting trade; and the cost of providing
security forces to deter raiding was high, while such forces were only intermittently successful against the more mobile
tribes*[@rogan_frontiers_1999] [@rogan_frontiers_1999 pg 84]. Also the capability to literally substitute the Empire as social and political organizations in the peripheries dangerously undermined its territorial integrity. Urban population and especially statesman and bureaucrats shared a common vision of the nomadic tribes, almost the same adjectives are used in describing their way of life: ranging from savage, ignorant and wild.

Every word can be referred to the contrast between the modernization ideas proposed by Sultan Abdülmecid I and the backwardness of the
periphery. The civilizing mission of the Ottoman Empire thus finds its own moral excuse in pursuing what is a purely political and
economical project. In a certain way this attitude resemble the famous Camillo Benso di Cavour’s statement: *Now that we have made Italy we
have to make Italians* pronounced after Italy’s unification and referring both to the cultural and linguistical differences in the
population but also to the necessity to acculturate and modernize the people living in the country. The main argument of this paper is then
to analyze the shift from inclusion of population through territory to the inclusion of territory through population during the late Ottoman
Empire focusing especially on the case of Transjordan nomadic tribes.

Definitions
===========

The peculiar context of Ottoman Empire requires attention both regarding the historical setting and the methodological tools that are going
to be used in this analysis: the terminology used is to be defined not from a qualitative but on a quantitative and neutral perspective to
avoid misinterpretations, also the origin of most of the concepts can lead to a biased explanation. Describing the last years of the Ottoman
Empire scholarly literature has used the terms of modernization, nation-state, colonialism (or neo-colonialism), that were usually meant to
be applied in the transformations that happened in Europe starting from the 16th century. Therefore if we want to borrow these concepts we
have first to understand how they can fit into the context of our study. In the Ottoman case the territorial integrity and the presence of
the state in the peripheral regions, here meant as borderlands with neighboring countries as well as all these areas were the friction
[@scott_art_2009] of terrain prevented a strong ad effective rule by the Ottoman authorities, is characterized by the lack of a strong
centralized rule and the presence of peculiar policies of live and let live with the local authorities that are functional to its own
existence. The so called modernization introduced after the Gulhane edict is to be intended as a process of strong centralization by
reducing the political distance between the center and the above mentioned peripheries, this was accomplished by strengthening the presence
of state’s bureaucrats and functionaries and their relative power regarding the local hierarchies and political structures. The idea
[@tilly1990coercion] that the centralization processes happened in Europe are correlated to the need of increasing the wealth extraction and
coercive power of the states regarding their subjects in their struggle for survival as political autonomous entities that characterized the
Middle Ages and the Modern History, let us introduce a neutral interpretation of modernization meant as an increase in the efficiency of the
state’s apparatuses; the correlation between this process and the development of Nation-states in Europe doesn’t take into account, though,
the well established power relations and policies of legitimating Ottoman power that were already present in all the regions under the
Empire’s control, and also overrides its multifarious nature regarding ethnic composition and religious practices.This is in neat contrast
to the “birth” and development of Nation states in European context since they all faced before or along the process of centralization a
parallel attitude of creating a mono ethnic and religious setting inside their borders.[@tilly1990coercion; @mann2004dark] So, to which
extent can we apply the concepts of nation and nation building to the case of Ottoman Empire? First of all we have to define the ideas at
their basis: Nation is usually defined as a community of people sharing common language, culture and history, that are aware of this unity
even if there is no actual political realization, and traditionally seen as a preexisting entity and justification for the realization of a
State-Nation especially by the national movements during the 19th century. But reversing this last statement we can also say that *Two men
are of the same nation if and only if they recognize each other as belonging to the same nation. In other words, nations maketh man; nations
are the artefacts of men’s convictions and loyalties and solidarities.* [@gellner2006nations pg 6] in this light we can also conceptualize
the process of nation building as an attempt pursued by political or intellectual elites to make a territorial unity overlap with the
population living in it under a shared idea of commonality thus an actively pursued program by the political power. Under this light, the
concept of state-building is fittest to the Tanzimât Era since it in Tilly’s terms consists in: *consolidation of territorial control,
differentiation of government from other organizations, acquisition of autonomy, [..] centralization and coordination.*
[@tilly1975formation pg 70] that describes quite well the transformations introduced in the bureaucratic apparatus. Conversely the idea of
nation-building is more directed to the establishment of a collective sense of community among the population. So the development of a
Nation state is just one of the possible outcomes of the centralization and state crafting process but not a necessary and direct
consequence. Therefore if we want to understand if the Empire’s policy of inclusion regarding nomad tribes can be assimilated in some way to
the process of nation building, we’ll have to analyze in which ways the settlement and acculturation programs were pursued and their
transformations during time.

Ottoman expansion in Transjordan
================================

The control of Transjordan was seen as necessary by Ottoman rulers for its strategical position as the main route to reach Arabian peninsula
and the holy cities of Islam on the pilgrimage path. The fertile and mostly unused lands in the region also were considered as a unused
asset of the Empire, a luxury that wasn’t acceptable in a period were the central government’s revenues were drastically decreasing due to
the loss of the European provinces. The penetration into the inner lands of southern Syria began officially in 1851 with the establishment
of an administrative centre in Irbil, the formal excuse was to protect villagers and farmers from the pillages carried on by the Sirhan and
Bani Kilab tribes, goal successfully achieved by the Ottoman army. While this proof of strength established a first presence in the area,
subsequent attempts to build more permanent solutions were deemed to failure, like the Algerian refugees colony that didn’t last after 1852,
and a peasant’s rebellion in May of the same year that drew out the direct Ottoman influence for other twelve years. In 1864 the Vilayet law
of provinces’ reform offered another justification for the intrusion of Ottoman’s officers in the region, with the appointment in 1866 of a
new Governor in Damascus who had as his primary goal to aplly the new laws: after securing Ottoman’s position in the North, Mehmet Raşid
begun a campaign in Southern Tranjordan 1867 through the ’Ajlun and then in the Balqa’ area. The region’s tribes were led by the ’Adawan,
and the expedition against them was a unprecedented success; after the attempt to take control again on the region by the leading tribes, a
second campaign stated the prominent role of the Ottomans.The intention to enter Arabian Peninsula from Transjordan led the campaign of 1872
to include Ma’an into the administrative region, but the costs of establishing a new administrative centre there were so high compared to
the revenues that it was shut down in 1873. After the British Empire conquered Egypt (1882) a new security concern about Ma’an’s strategic
position as a buffer area was at the base of proposals to create again an administrative unit in the city, but even if the governor renewed
his requests along all the 1880s it remained unattended by the Sultan. Given the small population of Ma’an the main interests of Ottoman
officers shifted to the bigger city of Karak where, after facing a strenuous resistence that was overcome mostly with negotiation and the
exchange of gifts, they achieved to permanently establish a new administrative outpost to extend the Empire’s influence directly into the
southernmost area of Syria. Already in 1868 the governor of Salt was expressing about the necessity to educate the children of the “savage”
population in the light of the reforms, and, although most of the officers appointed in the regions were Turks who had served the Empire
long before being sent to the turbulent Transjordan provinces, many of them were able to speak Arabic and therefore were able to negotiate
with the local authorities [@rogan2002frontiers pg. 56]. After imposing its presence with military strength Ottoman Empire was changing its
inclusionist policies to conquer the heart of the population. The main means to achieve this goal were to improve the infrastructures and
standardized systems of measure to improve economy, to appoint rightful officers limiting corruption and collusion, and thus stimulating in
the local ethnicities a sense of membership as part of the Empire. Especially the building of schools and structures to be used by the
collectivity was seen with enthusiasm by the local population and gave a sign of the benefits of being Empire’s subjects. Among the few
documents testifying administrative practice in Transjordan, there’s the evidence of the good memories left behind by Tahir Bey Badirkhan
who actively sought to improve the conditions of Irbil, the city he was appointed to in 1882, by rebuilding the old mosque and a primary
school but also solving the hydric supplies problems of the city by draining and cleaning the canals and the water tanks. Obviously not only
public buildings were necessary to prove the Empire’s presence but administrative structures were planned and built to efficiently carry the
basic tasks imposed by the Tanzimât reforms, like applying the rule of law and tax extraction: for example between 1874 and 1889 in Salt
were erected the Governor’s residence and Government office housing the local court and the district’s prison
[@rogan2002frontiers pg 61]. Even if the grandeur of the buildings was related to the centre’s importance also in the smallest towns were
built smaller structures carrying the Sultan’s symbols to testify the presence of the ruler in all the villages of the province. As a
consequence of this expansion in previously semi-autonomous regions one of the tasks to be accomplished was to effectively link the villages
to the administrative centres and these to the regional chief town. In the first years the establishment of a network of roads was more
related to the needs of the villagers for farming and trading purposes, but along with the increasing presence of Empire’s officers and
structures, projects of improvement of the roads and communication infrastructures were carried on in a more centralized form. The
establishment of the first telegraph line in south Syria was ordered by Sultan AbdulhamidII in 1892 and the first telegraph was sent on 6th
January 1901 [@rogan2002frontiers pg 64], the line was extremely important both in stating the Empire’s presence but also in providing its
subjects with means to easily and successfully send petitions to the centre, the necessity to protect the lines and poles also had the side
effect of including the bedouins as guards of the lines by providing monthly wages to the shaykhs to prevent damages to the lines from their
tribes’ members. Conversely the role played by the Hijaz railway reduced the income of the tribes on its path, before the building of the
railway their economic activities were supplemented by renting camels and get paid by the officer s to guarantee a safe passage to pilgrims,
thanks to the railway the need for both services constantly decreased and the shaikhs had to be pleased by lower monthly wages for the
protection of the rails. Another consequence of the improvement of the means of transportation with the building of paved roads, ferry lines
and railways was to increase the speed of deployment of troops while decreasing the costs of the expeditions, this combined with the
government structures that hosted prisons and police stations with a permanent presence of armed force in the villages was to impose the
Empire’s “monopoly of violence” in the region. In this context the military presence increased the chances of success in negotiations with
the tribes, therefore the improved security resulted also by the application of the laws provided the necessary setting for a general
increase in trade and economy.

Settlement program and the Land Law
===================================

The struggle to survive as a territorial and political unity against the increasing pressure of European countries in 19th century was one
of the main factor that forced Ottoman Empire to begin considering an optimization of its internal unused resources in terms of land,
revenues and military conviction. Tribes’ settlement has always been of fundamental importance for the Empire to assess its predominance in
the areas dwelt by nomadic tribes. Since this interactions are of a two-way nature there was mutual influence and adaptation; the policies
to approach the nomadic problem were geopolitically diversified, for example tribes living in border or in inaccessible areas were usually
granted more autonomy than the ones dwelling core regions, because the cost and the difficulties to conduct extensive military operations
against these population left this option as a last resort. State tribe dialectics were also dependent on the inside structure of the
latter, since in the concept of “nomadic tribe” are included very different kind of social structures, from highly hierarchical to almost
egalitarian ones, also the dispersion and the extent of the region actually used for grazing and transhumance patterns are an important
distinctive factor that influenced Empire’s policy and effectiveness. Summarizing, have been recognized three main factors influencing
Ottoman state’s strategies[@Koksal2006]:

1.  Geopolitical location

2.  Geographical boundedness, i.e. the degree of dispersion of different households

3.  Internal organization, i.e. the degree of hierarchical complexity

There is some kind of correlation between these variants: usually the higher the n2 the higher the n3. The n1 obviously is dependent on
geographical position and on state’s relations with neighboring countries. Previous studies recognized four main strategies deployed by the
Ottoman Empire to control and settle the tribes present in its territory up to the Tanzimât Era, mostly they’re not of coercive nature and
are: exile and military intervention, enclosing the tribe in a semi autonomous area and limit the intervention of the state just to collect
tributes, including the local leaders providing them arms and resources to help maintaining their rule and the use of trade and land
allocation to willingly include the population in a chosen area[@Koksal2006] Since the Empire was still expanding its territories there was
abundance of land to colonize, so the coercive practice of forced exile and the incentive to settle into allocated lands were a common
practice to pacify conflict situations between nomads and sedentary populations.  Both of them were part of the process to occupy new lands,
settled populations usually were stimulated to move to new lands with assignments, in the case of nomads tax exemptions to settle along
trade routes and watchtowers to protect them or in extreme cases forced exile were common methods. As the Empire stopped expanding and
entered into a financial crisis the forced exile method was used more and more often to solve internal conflicts especially in the inner
areas, along the borders some sort of autonomy was granted by selecting local leaders as interlocutors and providing them with financial and
military support in case of needing. The authority of local leaders backed up by the Empire relied on their ability to collect taxes from
their population and to keep quiet relations with the settled communities. Beginning with the Tanzimât Era we can observe a drastic change
in the pursuing of the settlement policy backed by the ideas at the very basis of the edict.  The concepts of equal rights and duties for
all, Muslim and non-Muslim: the guarantee for life, honor and private property, equal taxation and military service together with the idea
of a centralized bureaucratic administration pushed to important consequences as the first cadastral survey that begun in 1858 was also
followed by a nation wide census to record all male inhabitants present in the Empire and provided them with a tax certificate that also had
the purpose of an identification paper.  For the first time the Ottoman state attempted a mass scale settlement program: before 1839 as we
have seen sedentarization was used to solve contingent issues, but with the new impulse: *Regardless of whether they were a source of
disruption or not, tribes in several areas, including Bosnia, Kurdistan, Syria and Transjordan were forced or encouraged to settle
permanently in their respective regions* [@Koksal2006 pg 477] Still until 1860s the term used referring to the policies regarding nomads was
te’dib, that implies a form of violence and suppression, but then it was substituted in the documents with istimalet, that refers to an
approach meant to gain the good will of the protected[@Avci2009].  This change in the approach on nomadic issues is reflected also in the
formalization of another way to push the nomads to regularize their relations with the state by the approval of the Land Reform that was put
in the agenda of Ottoman officers from 1858. As a consequence the pastoral economy was to be modified as the state closed the migration
routes and imposed the registration of land and livestock properties.  The application of the Land Reform prevented nomadic tribes to
register their lands since they weren’t able to meet the two basic requirements to claim ownership: demonstrating with receipts to have paid
taxes on them or to have carried farming activities for the last three years.  This situation allowed the creation of new villages on
“unused” lands by settling refugees and farming tribes, one good example of this outcome is testified in the controversy between Sattam
Fayiz and the Christian ’Uzayzat tribe on the land surrounding the ruined village of Madaba, after a dispute with a Muslim tribe in their
home town of Karak, the ’Uzayzat were pushed by the local missionaries to move in the Balqa region, after a survey they found a suitable
place in Madaba. This village was considered by Sattam Fayiz, leader of the Bani Sakhr tribe, as part of his domains, therefore he
threatened the Christians to force them to go away from his lands. But the ’Uzayzat, keen on inter tribal politics, had an agreement with
the Bani Hamida tribe for mutual protection thus preventing Sattam Fayiz to realize his threats. The only option left for him was so the
application of a complain to the Ottoman Governor claiming the lands object of the controversy as his possession and then forcing the
Christians to return to Karak. But the Governor at that time was Midhat Paşa, whose main goal was to double the tax income of the province
by settling unused lands therefore he supported ’Uzayzat’s colonization of Madaba for farming purposes. When the leader of the Bani Sakhr
wasn’t able to produce neither the documents stating his tax payments nor to demonstrate that he farmed the land in the last three years
*Midhat Paşa instructed the regional governor in Nablus you should give as a reply to Sattam Fayiz’s claims to these and any other lands
that he has no right to lands not cultivated.* [@rogan2002frontiers pg 81] This movements of population eroded the interstices of unused
lands between villages by creating new settlements and establishing new administrative units as we have seen in the case of Beersheba,
leaving less and less territories to be exploited by nomads to graze their herds but also narrowing the distance between them and the
centres of Ottoman power. Along and as a reaction of the land grants for the foundation of new colonies to refugees and other settled
communities, nomadic tribes begun petitioning the government asking recognition for their lands on a legal basis. Favourable conditions to
induce the nomads to accept the new land regime were ordered by the government, like the exemption from the 10% tax on the estimated value
of the land registered, and lower fees on the registration costs. The success of this policy can be seen in the fact that as early as 1879
the first land register on the Salt area was completed, twelve years before the opening of the registration office in Salt. Since patterns
of private properties or rights similar to ownership were already present both in farming communities and in tribesmen the main difficulties
left to the Ottoman officers were how to “translate” them in the categories present in the law, in the process it appears that the
bureaucrats left most of the agreements on communal lands and on the names on which to register the ownerships to the local hierarchies,
focusing in adapting the different cases to the law’s standardized categories. This produced as outcome some variations in how the
properties were registered, for example the Bani Sakhr tribe divided the land between the more important families, while in other tribes
like the ’Adwan, ’Abbad and Balqawiyya all the tribesmen were assigned their share of land. Established hierarchies were probably an
important factor in differentiating these pattern of registration, since the Bani Sakhr were the largest tribe in the region and their
shaykhs the less settled, still relying mostly on herding for their income, and the most powerful, the others were more related with settled
communities as we have seen with the mutual protection agreement that the Bani Hamida and the ’Abbad tribe dealt with the Christian
community in Madaba and less hierarchical[@rogan2002frontiers]. The overall result of the application of the Land Reform was positive for
the tribes in the region, since almost all the unsettled lands were in their control, after the registration of the property rights they
also earned the possibility to sell the lands to the settled communities that desired to expand their fields as testified for example by the
land sold from the ’Adawan tribe to the Madaba villagers, but also to participate in ventures with merchants to farm the lands by hiring
seasonal workers and then selling the crops on the local markets, gaining higher profits than grazing stocks for self-sustainment and small
trade. On the other hand Ottoman authorities gained possess of all the lands that weren’t registered and were then able to use them as
grants to the tribes that accepted to use them for farming instead of pastures, therefore an overall increase in trade, productivity and
productive lands was followed by an higher amount of taxes collected. Also the new land regime imposed the tribes to be included in the
bureaucratic apparatus of the state if they wanted to gain from the benefits of it by registering ownership of their land, and as a
consequence to accept the state’s prominent role and presence.  Obviously the submission to the Empire wasn’t without consequences in tribal
hierarchies, the smallest tribes faced a depriving of their main sources of income, like raiding, and the shaykhs were left without the
necessary resources to maintain their standards of living nor the hospitality and redistribution traditions that granted them their higher
status among the tribesmen. These losses were paid back by honours, stipends and Ottoman titles for the most important tribes, for example
Bani Sakhr’s leader Sattam Fayiz was invited to Istanbul to receive the title of mudir, honours and stipends were given also to his son and
to his heir after his death; another important shaikh Sattam Sha’lan was given the title of mir miran Pasa, comparable to a provincial
governor, in exchange for his submission and the promise of settle down his tribe.  Conversely the lack of consideration for the less
important shaykhs made them turn against the imposition of the new taxes, as in the case of the Bani Hamida who stubbornly resisted the
count of their herds for taxation purposes and resumed their raids against villagers, caravans and Ottoman officers until the governor of
Syria led against them a military expedition in 1889. In the end *the Ottoman government recognized the limits of its authority in the
steppe, and limited its demands on the tribes to higher taxation. The government did not attempt to apply measures of conscription and
disarmament which were certain to provoke rebellion* [@rogan2002frontiers pg 190]

The civilizing mission
======================

Along the modernization of the Empire’s apparatus an ongoing segmentation between Ottoman (intended as “of Turkish origins”) and other
subjects of the Empire took shape in state’s officers minds regarding the populations living in the “peripheries”, especially about nomadic
ones. This image is part of the Ottoman modernization process that tended to build different categories interpreting those backward
populations of the Empire in contrast to the modern and “westernized” Turkish elite of the core regions. This paradox in Ottoman reforms,
the attempt of centralization through the inclusion of all the ethnicities of the Empire under the Ottoman citizenship, while segregating
the same different cultures into the box of backwardness led to the concept of “Ottomanization” as a way out of savagery to make the
tribesmen more civilized, but also as a justification for the ethnocentric and Turkish based dominating position in the Empire’s
bureaucratic apparatus.  Significantly the increasing integration with European markets and cultures demarcated the different relative speed
of change in the various provinces of the Empire: as seen by Ottoman bureaucrats the centre lived a different timing than the peripheries
thus leading to an increased span between their respective “acculturation”. Therefore the quicker integration of the centre offered a
further justification to the administrators for their civilizing mission, since it deepened the already well rooted perception of barbarism
in the outer provinces.  During the Tanzimât era the narrowing of the distance of the Arab provinces to the centre by building
infrastructures was seen as the first step of cultural inclusion. Then under the sultanat of Abdulhamid II (1876-1909) a new approach to
unify the Empire under one ideology was attempted in the shape of Islamism, particularly insisting on the title of Caliph as defender of the
faith and helper for Muslim populations, this was also used as a leverage when dealing with tribes pressuring on the unity of the community
of the faithful. This shift to a policy more based on religion triggered counter reaction by bureaucrats and intellectuals trained in the
western culture based schools founded during the Tanzimât that led to the promulgation of the first constitution. Especially the main
concept of Ottomanism was expressed in the 8th article: *All subjects of the Empire are called Ottomans, without distinction whatever faith
they profess; the status of an Ottoman is acquired and lost according to conditions specified by law* .  While during the Tanzimât period
the main goal was to establish permanently the Empire’s presence in the frontier regions in the attempt to build a strong centralized state
apparatus, in the subsequent years it become more and more important the creation of Ottoman subjects who shared a common sense of
membership that let a community made of different ethnicities become a Nation. But still among Ottoman administrators prevailed a two face
attitude regarding their subject: formal intolerance against diversity but pragmatic toleration especially in the case of the nomadic
populations that dwelt the peripheries. In Empire’s officers view, a still pervasive interpretation of Ibn Khaldoun’s concept of “clash of
civilization” persisted that drove their comments and ideas in a monolithic perception of backwardness and savagery regarding the nomadic
way of life[@Deringil2003]. The need of include these population in the Empire’s labor force and army pushed the same officers to turn to
the necessity of making them useful. The pragmatism that characterized the Empire’s attitude is particularly interesting in the case of
Libya were, after the English conquest of Egypt and the French presence in Algeria, the foreign threat is the biggest, this was not only an
enlightened policy but more a need to include the tribes in the defence of the territory since the Porte didn’t have the means to send
troops in case of necessity. On this case it’s also relevant to note that in the Abdulhamid II’s memorandum prescribing the practices to
follow to rule the province, the Sultan is concerned in gaining population’s hearts, so to make it possible to form a local armed force in
case of need to resist a foreign invasion without the need to send troops. This is supposed to be achieved by boosting local economy with
direct investments from the Empire’s treasure and importing modern equipment and tools from Europe to improve the effectiveness of
agricultural practices, but also to renovate the city showing the population the positive side effects of “civilization”. In the regions
along the coast of the Red Sea, namely Hicaz and Yemen, the increase of geopolitical importance not only by the ran for colonialism in
Africa but also for the inauguration of the Suez’ channel (1869), the most relevant feeling in the local governors is a sense of urgency in
imposing the presence of the state by building infrastructures and stressing on the need to educate the Arabs then to include local sheykhs
in administration of the province, all traits that outline the civilizing mission was pursued by Ottoman officers appointed to rule the
provinces. The building of schools in the villages to be attended by tribesmen’s sons was partly a reaction to the increasing influence of
missionaries who were indoctrinating the young in their schools, but also a mean to infuse Ottoman principles and ideas to the future
generations, turning them into citizens and to teach them the use of Turkish as a common language, so during *the Hamidian era mass
education was extended to the primary school level* [@deringil1998well pg 94] Especially the turn to Islam as a common trait on which build
the new sense of unity among the subjects of the Empire was going to be extremely influential in the definition of the curricula of the
secondary schools. The increasing amount of hours in class for religious training and the enforcement on religious practice was particularly
deep in the military schools were the students missing one prayer were prohibited to leave the school on the days off and in case of missing
the ramadan feasting they were convicted in school’s prison[@deringil1998well pg 97] The infusion of a “sacred sense of duty” was
predominant in the School of Civil Administration and the attempt to create a new administrative state elite faithful both to the doctrine
of Islam and to the sultan was one of Abdulhamid II’s main concerns. Also the institution of a group of Sunni Muslim missionaries to
contrast the widespread heresy present in the Empire’s territories, like shi’a, and the influence of Christian missionaries too often
sponsored by European countries to pursue their interests, like France and the Russian Empire and their protection respectively on the
catholic and orthodox communities in the Empire. The control on the non-Muslim schools sharpened during Abdulhamid II’s sultanat first with
the new Education Law that allowed educational commissions to control the syllabi then with the increased number of orders to close down
schools that weren’t conformed with the Ministry of Education’s regulations. Governors in peripheral provinces also stressed the necessity
to improve the teaching of Turkish starting from primary school to create a sense of membership to the same community between the different
ethnicities. *Clearly, the ibtidayie and rüşdiye schools that the imperial centre was encouraged to institute in the region were envisioned
as so many fortresses against foreign penetration.[..]hand in hand with the mission civilizatrice, as the vali did not neglect to state that
the tribes ’who live in a state of nomadism, savagery and ignorance’, had to be ’brought into the community of the civilized people’*
[pg 100[<span>deringil1998well</span> The necessity to use education to create a suitable environment to rule the peripheral regions was both a suggestion from local officers who recognized the usefulness to infuse the populations with Ottoman ideals and an active policy of the Sultan to build a new community faithful to him. With this kind of premises the foundation of the Aşiret Mektebi seems a logical consequence. Two steps led to the realization of the tribe school: first 48 students from peripheral provinces were invited to Istanbul to study at the military academy, after they graduated were appointed to honored positions in their home regions for *both in town and among your own [tribes] many children who see you will wish to be like you* [@rogan1996acsiret pg 85]. Then Ottoman authorities succeeded in inviting Sattam al-Sha’lan, the shaykh of one of the most important arab tribes in Syrian province, to come in Istanbul and after he committed to settle his
people the Porte granted him honors, and promoted him to pasha, the shaykh even left one of his sons in the city to be given an Ottoman
education. This event had a great impression on other shaykhs of the same region and many of them followed his lead, thus proving the
success of this policy as we can see in Ottoman archives the numerous petition asking for official invitation to the capitol in the hope to
receive the same grants. Actually the state’s project (and hope) was more related to shaykhs’ sons, since the arab rulers were too old to be
indoctrinated their young sons were a perfect bet for a long term policy of inclusion: the institution of a school for the future leaders of
nomadic tribes influencing their cultural formation and infusing them with the concepts of Ottoman citizenship and loyalty to the Sultan. In
this way both the “civilizing mission” and the conquest of the heart and mind of Arab tribes could be accomplished. Despite this “glorious”
premise, the tribe school never reached really the hearts of all the tribes: instead the estimated total of 450 alumni just 88 were enrolled
in the first three years. Also an example of a graduate behavior after he got back to his tribe can witness how the program was only
partially successful: Muhammad Barjis al-Farham, from Aleppo province, was met by a Czech geographer that reported him saying that the
school made him familiar to Ottoman bureaucracy and customs, but this knowledge let him *coax large tracts of land from the Government, both
for himself and his tribe* [@rogan1996acsiret pg 97] more than feeling loyalty and gratefulness to the Ottomans. At least his project was to
settle down his people and turn his land in productive fields thus partially fulfilling the goals of Ottoman’s administration. On the other
side many graduates served the Empire up to its end. An overall evaluation of this social engineering project is impossible to achieve since
this kind of experiments need time to develop and to reach their goal: the school was founded in 1892 and closed in 1907 cause of a student
rebellion, and the Empire was on the edge of its dissolution culminated in 1923.

Hybrid sovereignty and the Nationalist discourse
================================================

Three trajectories are recognized in the Empire contrasting the well-established interpretation of center versus periphery [@Emrence2008 pg 298]: coastal, characterized by the inclusion in the European sphere of influence through the port cities and trade networks, and represented by the Western Anatolia, Lebanon and the Mediterranean provinces of Rumelia, interior who was the core area of the Empire: Anatolia, Syria and Palestine, mostly populated by Arab and Turkish farmers and herders, and the frontier were the authority of the Sultan was extremely tenuous, in some cases even inconsistent[@rogan2002frontiers pg 42]. The discourse of the injection of Ottoman ideals in the Transjordan region is a process of intrusion after the opening of the frontier[@rogan2002frontiers pg 5], the Ottomanization discourse penetrated the territories by creating new settlements and induced an optimization of the land use in the area, increased the tax extraction and included the local notables in a more centralized administration.  The need to constantly rely on bargaining practices to relate with the tribes or even to leave them dealing with internal struggles, like what happened for the registration of land when every tribe decided how and on which name(s) register the ownership, didn’t eradicate the local networks of kin and trade relations that were precedent the intrusion of the Empire. As a consequence the prominent role that officers, governors and the Sultan himself had to grant to the most important shaykhs allowed the enhancement of their relative power and the enlargement of their networks, especially those who were successful in extending their influence as trade partners of the merchants who were attracted by the establishment of new commercial networks thanks to the enhanced security ensured by the Empire’s presence. Thus the intrusion of the Ottomans and their co-opting practices broke *the circular, self perpetuating, and self reinforcing mechanism inherent [..] self administering groups [that] result in a weak or absent central agency* [@gellner1991tribes pg 109] with the side effect of an increase of the relative power of the shaykhs’ authority among their own tribes. As *a large, functioning empire goes through a continuous cycle of building up power in its peripheral units only to see those who have direct access to that power turn it to their own ends* [@tilly1975formation pg 29], what was taking shape in Transjordan along with the increasing presence and efficiency of the Ottoman bureaucratic apparatus was a hybrid sovereignty[@bacik2007hybrid] characterized by the overlapping presence of more than one hegemonic discourse. The peculiarity of the context was that after a first Ottoman intrusion mostly characterized by violence to impose direct rule and the reforms of the Tanzimât, the policies to maintain the control of the region shifted to a more inclusive attitude deeply relying on the role of established pattern of power based on the local elites, especially during the Hamidian period with the attempts to conquer the hearts of the population and the social engineering experiment of the Tribe School. There isn’t a neat distinction in these two approaches since the military campaigns to penetrate the southernmost parts of Transjordan continued up the the end of the 19th century (thus under Abdulhamid II sultanat) and it seems more an adaptive strategy of the rule strategies that actually begun just with the first attempts to impose the reforms, as the appointed governors were using a firm hand as a last resort relying more on participating actively in the improvement of the cities and villages by building infrastructures and collective buildings. As we have seen for example in the application of the Land Reform or in the Abdulhamid II’s memorandum a common trait of the Ottoman officers was a pragmatic approach to deal with the tribes, more based on achieving the final result by bargaining or bribing with gifts and titles that on the straight imposition of Sultan’s rule by strength, the same strategy used for example to enter Karak durign the first expansion in Transjordan. The change in the attitude if Ottoman officers toward the so called civilizing mission was a consequence of the need to progressively include the tribes and “uncivilized” populations into the increasing centralized administrative practices of the Empire, that paradoxically led to the creation a conceptual distinction between the Ottoman elite and its subjects in what Selim Deringil calls a moral distance between the two, and that he acknowledges as being a main similarity to a colonialist behavior in the Empire’s elite. At the beginning of the 19th century, after the young Turks came into power, this process *heated up, some of the Arabists accused the CUP of having been intent on concentrating the power of the state in Turkish hands and treating the non-Turkish elements in the Ottoman Empire just like colonial France treated the Algerians* [@Deringil2003 pg 341] Despite the comparison with the Hapsburg and Russian Empires on the basis that none of them successfully faced the challenge of modern Nation states [@barkey2008empire] it is interesting to notice that Ottoman Empire shows some similarities also with the Italian and (to some extent) German cases, all of them faced the unification and centralization process in the “second wave” of state and nation building during the 19th century and all of them first had to impose the center’s prominent role in their “peripheries” (with the due differences of course) and then strengthening the role of education to grasp people’s hearts and to build the collective consciousness at the basis of the nation-building. Then after the 1st World War they turned in strong nationalistic and ethnocentric autocratic (dictatorial) regimes. In this sense the Tanzimât reforms can be interpreted not as a failed attempt to achieve modernity in the struggle to survive posed by the challenging European Nation states but part of a long term process that eventually contributed to put the basis for the birth of the Turkish republic after the loss of the outer provinces of the Ottoman Empire.

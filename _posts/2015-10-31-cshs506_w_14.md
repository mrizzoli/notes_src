## RESPONSE PAPER: WEEK 14 - TECHNOLOGY AND THE BODY

Beside the ethnographic work done by the author, the approach to the history of transplants and transplants legislation in Turkey has some serious and interesting issues. The idea of manipulating the body and its internal parts has numerous drawbacks especially in the fields of ethics and religion, regarding this is of extreme interest to note that the approach to the subject can't be done without taking into account the social and individual prejudices implied when dealing with human bodies and lives. The term "Bioethics" coined by the American oncologist V.R. Potter in 1970 refers  to the sub-discipline that is supposed to analyze and clarify the boundaries of scientific research regarding the increasing manipulating power of science on human life. As a bridge between the fields of biology and ethics it has to deal with the fact that the latter is not generalizable in a concept that applies to all cultural frameworks in the world, since there are peculiarities that prevent that and define different attitudes on the conceptualizations of death, body and illness. On this point we should trace a neat definition between Moral (from the Latin mos: custom, practice) as the sub-field of philosophy that tries to abstract universal values and Ethics (from the Greek word ἦθος: behavior, habit) in its more empirical being.  This empiricism has as a consequence that the values at its basis that define what is good and what is evil can be particularized up to the individual. Among the examples offered in the book, two of them are interesting in this aspect and on a certain point of view can encompass the author's theories and ideas: Dr S. case and Aziz. The latter is one of the patients that were interviewed during the ethnographic survey on kidney failures and is the only case in which the subject was able to comprehend what was going on and how to gather information by consulting multiple doctors, thanks to his education and job position. After having a clearer picture of his own situation Aziz was faced with two possibilities, the first was to travel to India and buy a new kidney or to go to Moscow and enroll in the waiting list for a transplant. Since the first option was probably putting him into the illegal organ trafficking he chose the second even if it was to wait longer. The ethical choice he made was about the fact that the market of internal organs relies on the poverty (or desperate situations) that drives people to sell their organs for quick money, and even in the case they're told about all the risks involved in this kind of trade (i.e. from the surgery to the difficulties and danger of living without one kidney) their situation usually leave them no choice. The same kind of dilemma is at the base of all the problems faced by Dr S. who is directly involved in the organ market providing his waiting patients with willing donors who accept to sell their organs as part of an economic transaction. Even after being arrested several times he keeps on stating that there's nothing illegal in setting up this kind of trade since all the donors (sellers) are well informed about the risks and signed an “informed consent” paper as a proof of their will. Beside that, the receivers (buyers) are facing certain death (or at least a life full of difficulties) if they don't find the organs in due time, in this view his patients see him like a modern Robin Hood that stretches the Turkish laws for their well-being. This commodification of body parts is a consequence of numerous factors, first of all the introduction of Neo-liberalist ideas in Turkish economy that led to the booming of private clinics involved in the remunerative transplant surgery, second the haziness of Turkish law that doesn't clearly take a position against the organ trade leaving the possibility to sneak through quibbles, and third the ongoing debate on the use of brain dead individuals as donors. If for the above mentioned cases the ethical question is about the possibility to sell people's internal organs and how this practice influence the perception of the body and of human life as marketable commodities, the issues on the idea of using brain dead donors are more rooted into religion and the moral question about what is death and how we understand it. In particular with the development of life supporting medical equipment that provide artificial aid to the main body functions like respiration and heartbeat, the question about life has become of primary importance since the distinction between persistent vegetative state and brain death is the key to distinguish from which subjects the organs can be transplanted. In medical terms the brain death occurs when all the cerebral activity stops in an irreversible way due to the necrosis of its parts (neurons) and is different from the vegetative state because the latter can be reversible even if with extremely low probabilities. The fact that the subject's heart is still beating poses serious questions on the fact if the death of the brain alone can be connected to the death of the whole individual, especially when referring to religious concept of life as something that permeates the wholeness of the body as expressed by the Persian word Jann (translitterated in the Turkish Can). Thus the Ethic question of evaluating the “degrees of death” intertwines with the different skills of the doctors to make their prognosis, even more than that this relies on medical definitions and concepts, thus there is also the necessity to inform and instruct people about the biological differences between brain death and the irreversible vegetative state in which at least the cerebral functions of the individual are still present (even if often damaged). Thus both the possibilities to find donors have serious drawbacks that involve Ethic dilemmas and are intertwined with the society itself: the crawling Neoliberalism that is increasingly permeating the economic lives and moves the threshold of what is marketable further and further including even body parts and internal organs from living subjects that to overcome their economic difficulties end to commodify their own bodies, and the biological differentiation of different kind (or “degrees”) of deaths that challenges the religious beliefs of the holiness of the body thus putting the doctors in the uncomfortable position of having to deal with metaphysical topics while trying to save the lives of their patients while “killing” or mutilating other subjects that are still alive in the eyes of their relatives.
